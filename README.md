  - High barriers to entry and intense competitive rivalry.
  - High buyer bargaining power due to critical demand for effective fraud prevention.
- **PESTLE Analysis**:
  - Influence of political, economic, and technological factors on fraud detection systems.

### 4. Data Features
- **Transaction Data**:
  - Time, location, amount, and cardholder behavioral patterns.
- **Merchant Risk Scores**:
  - Historical fraud rates and chargeback patterns.
- **Geographic Features**:
  - Transaction distances and IP addresses.

### 5. Challenges and Mitigations
- **Class Imbalance**:
  - Addressed with SMOTE and Borderline-SMOTE techniques.
- **Concept Drift**:
  - Continuous model updates and aggregation of features to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
- **Model Interpretability**:
  - Ensured with decision tree algorithms for compliance and user trust.

### 6. Model Evaluation Metrics
